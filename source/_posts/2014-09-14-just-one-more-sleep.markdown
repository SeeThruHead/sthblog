Wow, It's finally here. When I leave the house tomorrow it won't be to slog out another 8 hour day serving shitty drinks to degenerates. Tomorrow I start a full time immersive Front-End bootcamp at [@HackerYou](https://twitter.com/hackeryou). It's hard to believe this is actually happening. It may sound like I'm overhyping it, or just overly excited. But if someone had asked me what my life plan was 6 months ago I wouldn't of had an answer for them. University is far too expensive and I feel like college is worth so little that it doesn't justify the amount of time put into it. I really had no idea how I was going to gain the knowledge needed to pursue a fulfilling career.

So it suffices to say that I'm incredibly excited. (I've probably mentioned this in every blog post so far haven't I...)

I really can't wait to meet my new instructors and to see the instructors/mentors from my part time class again. Just the thought of spending 8 hours a day in class with people as determined as I am to learn something new is a refreshing thought when compared to how I've spent most of my days over the past few years.

Now aside from being excited all week I've been doing some more reading. I started into a really great book called [Code Complete](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670) by Steve McConnel. I came across this book while searching for a language agnostic programming guide.

I mentioned in a previous post that I'd detail some extreme finance tips that are helping me to be able to live on very little money. As most of my money throughout the bootcamp will be going to food one of the most important things you can do is eat on the cheap. For this week I've been eating my standard Oatmeal + Honey + Fruit in the morning. For dinner I decided to make a stew and literally just made the [first recipe for beef stew](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/beef-stew-vi/) that popped up on google. The approximate total cost for a serving of this stew when put on a bed of rice is about 2 dollars. Not bad I think. I'd be grateful to hear any tips for eating cheaply that anyone's willing to share.

{% img left /images/posts/mailgift.jpg 400 %} On another note I received a surprise in the mail at the beginning of the week. It came at a perfect time as my asus t100 tablet crapped out and basically halted my subway reading altogether. The staff over at HackerYou are incredibly thoughtful.

Now to end off this blog post I'm going to link some things that I came across this week. I thought of the idea on Wednesday and started keeping a log of all the articles and videos that I watched (when I remembered to) partly for my own record but more for anyone who wants some interesting to look into.
