This post has been a while coming. I'll admit I've actually been dreading it. I'm a terrible writer and have been so incredibly out of practice for so long that the whole idea has been a bit daunting.

Now with that out of the way I suppose I'll move on to the meat of the post. I'm a 27 year old Toronto native who's been working in the service industry for about 7 years now. Partly due to my own laziness I've not really progressed at all in those 7 years. I've mostly just wasted time.

So I recently made the decision to put it all behind me and take a risk on something new. The first step was to enroll in a [HackerYou](http://www.hackeryou.com) part time Intro to HTML & CSS course that I discovered while researching coding bootcamps. I was barely able to afford cost of tution by working at an after hours bar in the city. Let me tell you, I enjoyed that class more than anything I've done in a long long while. It was easily worth every penny. I came out of it with a decent understanding of HTML and CSS and a hunger to learn more.

So I decided I was going to get a little more hardcore and quit my job and take the full time immersive bootcamp in September.

From the end of the part-time course until now has been quite stressful and exciting. I've been focussing on 1. coming up with the money to attend the bootcamp and 2. learning as much as possible before I get there. For the money part I've basically finally started to become even remotely responsible with my money. That means no more eating out at restauraunts or movies or the like. I also sold almost everything I've accumulated over the years. I'm almost just down to my bicycle and a macbook. I leave home every day with no money and no debit/credit cards in my wallet just to make sure I don't waste any money.

As for the learning I've read Design for Hackers, The Design of Everyday Things, Sass for Web Designers, Eloquent Javascript (Up until the functional programming section), Javascript the Good Parts (first few chapters). Aside from books I've been digging into blogs and posts on twitter from the likes of Drew Minns, Wes Bos, Chris Coyier, Paul Irish, Addy Osmani, Sara Soueidan, Ben Schwarz and many others. Hopefully I've done enough preparation.

Now the purpose for the blog is going to be varied. Foremost to document my journey from dead end job to fulfilling career. A little bit about finances and how I'm managing to live/eat for very litte money. And likely a lot of just straight coding talk. I really want to talk about what I've learned and am going to be learning throughout this process.

Class starts on Monday and I couldn't be more excited.
